      <h1> About Me</h1>
      <img src="assets/20191217_010750.jpg" width="200" alt="">
      <p>
        I was born in California, in the Bay area near San Francisco, also know as Silicon Valley.
        I have lived in North Carolina since I was five. However, I was still was rasied like a west coast kid, so I do not have much of a southern flare.
        I am a nerd in every since of the word. I have love a various things such as science fiction, animation, music, sports and various channels on Youtube. 
        Music is my favorite hobbie as I play guitar whenever I can.  

      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I live in Cary. I attended East Carolina Univeristy from 2014-2019
        and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Interpersonal/Organization Communications. As a pirate alumini,
        I set to embark on journey into the world of programming, hoping it will take to me to grand places.
