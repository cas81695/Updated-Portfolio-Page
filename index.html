        <h1>About Me</h1>

          <img src="assets/20191217_010750.jpg" class="auth-image">

          <p>
            I was born in California, in the Bay area near San Francisco, also know as Silicon Valley.
            I have lived in North Carolina since I was five. I was raised like a west coast kid, so I am still faithful to the bay area like it's my home.
            I am a nerd in every since of the word. I love various forms of entertainment such as science fiction, animation, music, sports and various channels on Youtube. 
            Music is my favorite hobbie as I play guitar whenever I can.  
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
           Currently, I live in Cary. I attended East Carolina Univeristy from 2014-2019
           and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Interpersonal/Organization Communications. As a pirate alumini,
            I am set to embark on journey into the world of programming, hoping it will take to me to grand places. With my creativity and love for collaberation, I am excited on proving my skills as a developer.
